PROMINENCE is a platform which allows users to exploit idle cloud resources for running scientific workloads with a simple batch system style interface.
* Users are no longer tied to a login node: jobs can be submitted from anywhere using any OS and any language.
* All jobs are run in containers to ensure they will can run reliably anywhere and are reproducible.
* Run multi-node MPI jobs in addition to HTC jobs.
* On-premises resources can be utilised with the ability to burst onto external clouds at times of peak demand.
* Go beyond bursting onto a single external cloud with hierarchical cloud bursting. For example, burst onto national research clouds before bursting onto public clouds.
* All infrastructure provisioning is handled completely automatically and is totally transparent to the user.
* Clouds are selected automatically based on job requirements and preferences, and any failures are handled automatically.
* Jobs can access data from external storage like [B2DROP](https://b2drop.eudat.eu) or [OneData](https://onedata.org) via a POSIX-like filesystem.
* Output data can be accessed from cloud-based object storage.
