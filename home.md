  Enabling HTC & HPC applications opportunistically across private, academic and public clouds. 
---

PROMINENCE is a platform which allows users to exploit idle cloud resources for running scientific workloads.

### Flexible submission
Don't be tied to a login node. Submit jobs using a simple batch system style command line interface from your laptop. And your desktop. Or from anywhere else. Also submit jobs programmatically using a RESTful API.

### Reliabilily and reproduceability
All jobs are run in containers to ensure they will can run reliably anywhere and are reproducible.

### MPI ready
Run multi-node Open MPI or MPICH jobs in addition to single-node HTC jobs.

### Multi-cloud native
Go beyond a single cloud and leverage resources across many clouds.

### Invisible infrastructure
All infrastructure provisioning is handled completely automatically and is totally transparent to the user.

### Data access
Jobs can access data from external storage like [B2DROP](https://b2drop.eudat.eu) or [OneData](https://onedata.org) via a POSIX-like filesystem. Alternatively output data can be accessed from cloud-based object storage.
