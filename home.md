**Flexible submission**<br/>
Submit jobs using a simple batch system style command line interface from your laptop. And your desktop. Or from anywhere else. Or interact programmatically using a RESTful API.
<br/>

**Reliability and reproduceability**<br/>
All jobs are run in containers to ensure they will can run reliably anywhere and are reproducible.

**Multi-cloud native**<br/>
Go beyond a single cloud and leverage resources across many clouds. Clouds will be assigned based on job requirements and any preferences.

**Invisible infrastructure**<br/>
All infrastructure provisioning is handled completely automatically and is totally transparent to the user.

**Data access**<br/>
Jobs can access data from external storage like [B2DROP](https://b2drop.eudat.eu) or [OneData](https://onedata.org) via a POSIX-like filesystem.
