  Enabling HTC & HPC applications opportunistically across private, academic and public clouds.

PROMINENCE is a platform which allows users to exploit idle cloud resources for running scientific workloads.

### Flexible submission
<img align="left" width="80" height="80" src="prominence-job-submission.png" hspace="20">
Don't be tied to a login node. Submit jobs using a simple batch system style command line interface from your laptop. And your desktop. Or from anywhere else. Also submit jobs programmatically using a RESTful API.
<br/>


### Reliabilily and reproduceability
<img align="left" width="80" height="80" src="prominence-containers.png" hspace="20">
All jobs are run in containers to ensure they will can run reliably anywhere and are reproducible.
<br/>


### MPI ready
<img align="left" width="80" height="80" src="prominence-multi-node.png" hspace="20">
Run multi-node Open MPI or MPICH jobs in addition to single-node HTC jobs.
<br/>


### Multi-cloud native
<img align="left" width="80" height="80" src="prominence-burst.png" hspace="20">
Go beyond a single cloud and leverage resources across many clouds. Jobs will run on the best available cloud meeting their requirements and any preferences.
<br/>


### Invisible infrastructure
All infrastructure provisioning is handled completely automatically and is totally transparent to the user.


### Data access
<img align="left" width="80" height="80" src="prominence-storage.png" hspace="20">
Jobs can access data from external storage like [B2DROP](https://b2drop.eudat.eu) or [OneData](https://onedata.org) via a POSIX-like filesystem. Alternatively output data can be accessed from cloud-based object storage.
