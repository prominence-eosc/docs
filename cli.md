# Command line interface
The PROMINENCE Command Line Interface (CLI) provides a simple batch system like experience for interacting with PROMINENCE.
However, unlike a traditional batch system where users need to ssh into a login node,
the PROMINENCE CLI can be installed and run anywhere where Python 3 is available.
