<h3>Workflows</h3>
Construct complex workflows by specifying the dependencies between different jobs, or run large numbers
of similar jobs, for example for parameter scans, based on templates.
<br/>
<br/>

<h3>Data access</h3>
Jobs can access data from object storage or in a POSIX-like way from [OneData](https://onedata.org) or WebDAV (including [B2DROP](https://b2drop.eudat.eu)).
