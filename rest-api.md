#### Request Body

The following fields are used in the request body for creating a job:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `resources` | `resources` | Yes | CPU, memory and disk resource requirements. |
| `inputs` | | No | List of filenames and their base64-encoded content to be made available to jobs. |
| `outputFiles` | `array[string]` | No | List of output filenames to be uploaded to storage. |
| `outputDirs` | `array[string]` | No | List of output directories to be uploaded to storage. |
| `artifacts` | `array[string]` | No | List of URLs to fetch before the job starts. |
| `labels` | `array[string]` | No | List of arbitrary labels in the form of name-value pairs, e.g. `name=value`. |
| `tasks` | `array[task]` | Yes | List of tasks |
| `policies` |  | No | Job policies. |
| `notifications` |  | No | Job notifications. |

`resources`:
| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `nodes` | `integer` | No | Number of nodes required. |
| `cpus` | `integer` | No | Number of CPU cores per node required. |
| `cpusRange` | `integer`,`integer` | No | Minimum and maximum number of CPU cores per node required. |
| `cpusOptions` | `integer`,`integer` | No | Minimum and maximum number of CPU cores per node required. |
| `cpusTotalRange` | `integer`,`integer` | No | Minimum and maximum number of total CPU cores across all nodes required. |
| `memory` | `integer` | No | Memory per node required in GB. |
| `memoryPerCpu` | `integer` | No | Memory per CPU core required in GB. |
| `disk` | `integer` | No | Disk space required in GB. |ยง

`task`:
| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `image` | `string` | Yes | Container image name. |
| `runtime` | `string` | No | Container runtime, either `singularity` (default) or `udocker`. |
| `cmd` | `string` | No | Command to run inside the container. |
| `args` | `string` | No | Arguments of command run inside the container. |
| `env` | `dict` | No | Dictionary of key-value pairs. |
| `workDir` | `string` | No | Working directory. |
| `type` | `string` | No | Type of task, one of `basic`, `sidecar`, `openmpi`, `mpich`, or `intelmpi`. |

`policies`:
| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `maximumRetries` | `integer` | No | Maximum number of times a task will be retried in the event of failures. By default there will be no retries. |
| `maximumTimeInQueue` | `integer` | No | Maximum time in minutes the job will remain in the queue. If a job cannot be run immediately it will wait in the queue (up to the specified time limit) until resources become available. The value -1 means that the job will remain in the queue until it starts running. The default value 0 means that the job will remain in the queue until it starts running or there is a failure. |
| `leaveInQueue` | `bool` | No | 
| `ignoreTaskTailures` | `bool` | No | normally if a task fails (i.e. exit code non-zero) no further tasks will be executed in a job. If set to True, all tasks will be executed. |
| `reportJobSuccessOnTaskFailure` | `bool` | No | When the job is run as part of a workflow, if the exit code of any tasks are non-zero the job will be reported as running successfully. This means that if retries are enabled within a workflow or a workflow is re-run, only jobs which failed because of infrastructure problems will be retried (e.g. problems pulling the container image or staging files in or out). The default value is `False`. tasks in a job will be run irrespective of any failures. The default value is False. |
| `autoScalingType` | `string` | No | If set to `none` only existing resources will be considered to run the job and no additional resources will be provisioned. |
| `runSerialTasksOnAllNodes` | `bool` | No | By default serial tasks are only run on one node for the case of multi-node jobs. Setting this to `True` results in serial tasks being run on all nodes. |
| `priority` | `integer` | No | Job priority. |
| `placement` | `placement` | No |

`notifications`:
| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
