There are several types of workflows available in PROMINENCE.

## Directed acyclic graphs
A directed acyclic graph (DAG) is a collection of all the jobs you want to run organised in a way that reflects their dependencies.

## Job factories
A job factory allows many jobs to be created from a job template.
